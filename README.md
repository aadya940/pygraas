### PyGraas: A Vulnerability Analysis and Restriction Layer for Python Packages.

We ensure runtime safety by providing a Graph Analytics and
Restriction layer on top of Python Packages.

##### Features:
-  Build DependencyGraph for Python Packages.
-  Detect Vulnerable Python Dependencies using VulnerabilityGraph, analyse
  these graphs.
- Block Vulnerable functions,even the ones deep in the call stack.
- A toolkit for security of python packages and graph analytics.
- Easy to use API.

### Installation
- Download the wheel from `https://github.com/aadya940/pygraas`.
- pip install (.whl file).
- Follow `Examples` section.

### Notes

Requires: `Git` & `PyDeps`.

PyGraas executes shell commands internally, hence `git` and `pydeps` need to 
be configured correctly and be added to system path.
