### PyGraas: A Vulnerability Analysis and Restriction Layer for Python Packages.

We ensure runtime safety by providing a Graph Analytics and
Restriction layer on top of Python Packages.

### Features:
🟢  Build DependencyGraph for Python Packages. <br>
🟢 Detect Vulnerable Python Dependencies using VulnerabilityGraph, analyse
these graphs. <br>
🟢 Block Vulnerable functions, even the ones deep in the call stack. <br>
🟢 A toolkit for security of python packages and graph analytics. <br>
🟢 Easy to use API. <br>

### Installation
🔴 Download the wheel from `https://github.com/aadya940/pygraas`. <br>
🔴 pip install (.whl file). <br>
🔴 Follow `Examples` section. <br>

### Notes
```
> Requires: `Git` & `PyDeps`.
> PyGraas executes shell commands internally, hence `git` and `pydeps` need to 
be configured correctly and be added to system path.
